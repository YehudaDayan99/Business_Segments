  "rationale": "Table t0015 disaggregates revenue by business lines matching the requested product categories: iPhone, Mac, iPad, Wearables, Home and Accessories, and Services. It includes a Total net sales row and covers recent fiscal years 2023, 2024, and 2025. This table aligns well with the preferred criteria of showing granular product/service line items rather than just segment totals, and it is from Item 8 / Notes section with recent years."
