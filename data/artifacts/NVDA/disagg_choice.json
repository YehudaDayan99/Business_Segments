  "rationale": "This table disaggregates revenue by business lines labeled as 'Compute & Networking' and 'Graphics', which match the company's reported segments. It includes multiple recent fiscal years (2023, 2024, 2025) and has a Total Revenue row. Although the inferred dimension is unknown, the nearby text context indicates it presents details of reportable segments and the 'All Other' category. No product/service-level table was found in the candidates, so this segment-level table is the best available choice."
